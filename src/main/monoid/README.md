1. Endofunctor is a function whose arguement and return type are same. 
    Identity is the simplest endofunctor. 
    
2. A monoid homomorphism f between monoids M and N holds  (homomorphism - same shape)
 M.op(f(x), f(y)) = f(N.op(x,y))
 
3. A monoid isomophism between M and N has two functions f and g such that f andThen g = g andThen f (isomorphism - equal shape)
